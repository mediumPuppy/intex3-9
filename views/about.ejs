       <h2>OUR PASSION...</h2>
        <p>
           Resonates with understanding the delicate balance between the vibrant world of social media and our mental well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Picture this: a digital landscape teeming with possibilities, but with an ethos centered
          around harnessing its power judiciously. Our mission is not just about unraveling the mysteries of social media; 
          it's about crafting a symphony of strategies that allow us to harmoniously navigate life's highs and lows amidst 
          the ever-present allure of our digital age.

      <div class="splitscreen intro">
        <div class="left-div">

        <p>Here at SMU&MH, we embark on a fascinating journey, where the goal isn't merely to avoid social media but to 
          embrace it thoughtfully. We aim to transform the way we engage online, to transform it into a catalyst for 
          building a vibrant and deeply connected community right here in Provo. It's not about disconnecting but about 
          connecting meaningfully, fostering genuine relationships, and using these digital platforms as tools for positive 
          change.
        </p>

        <p>Together, let's craft a digital era where social media isn't just an endless void of doom scrolling but a canvas 
          for fostering empathy, supporting mental wellness, and forging meaningful connections. Let's explore these 
          platforms while cherishing the invaluable moments of human connection they enable.
